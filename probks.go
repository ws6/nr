//Kolmogorov-Smirnov probability function.
//Given an array data1[1..n1], and an array data2[1..n2], this routine returns the Kâ€“
//S statistic d, and the significance level prob for the null hypothesis that the data sets are
//drawn from the same distribution. Small values of prob showtha t the cumulative distribution
//function of data1 is significantly different from that of data2. The arrays data1 and data2
//are modified by being sorted into ascending order.
